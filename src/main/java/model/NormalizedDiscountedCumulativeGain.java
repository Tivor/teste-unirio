/**
 * <p>Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain </p>
 * <p/>
 * This measure was introduced in Jarvelin, Kekalainen, "IR Evaluation Methods
 * for Retrieving Highly Relevant Documents" SIGIR 2001.  I copied the formula
 * from Vassilvitskii, "Using Web-Graph Distance for Relevance Feedback in Web
 * Search", SIGIR 2006.
 * <p/>
 * Score = N \sum_i (2^{r(i)} - 1) / \log(1 + i)
 * <p/>
 * Where N is such that the score cannot be greater than 1.  We compute this
 * by computing the DCG (unnormalized) of a perfect ranking.
